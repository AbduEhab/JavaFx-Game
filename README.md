ToDo: redo the view to make it more appealing and optimize some code

This is a Hearthstone style game made with java using the FX library. Originaly made as a uni project, but i thought people might wanna look through it to learn more about java and oop in general. So I added a few quality of life features and I'm going to leave it here.

Special thanks to fad11 for adding his own touch here and there.

Note: Audio clips may cause a problem for some IDE's so i commented them out.
